# HexEsp is a Breakout Board of amazing ESP8266 in a nice Hexagon PCB.

First thank you for visiting my project, I tell them that I'm not an electronics engineer, I'm just an amateur (passionate) the maker movement, and this is the second board that I make, I am supporting the designs of @Adafruit and @NodeMCU.
